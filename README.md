# LogicMonitor
LogicMonitor is a cool product, but its as deep as it is customizable. Here are some things I have sorted out.

## ActiveDirectory-ServerInventory.ps1
Set your OU's and domain and get a CSV in the format that LM wants for import.

## Add-SQL-Monitoring-User.sql

Set your Windows user to add to each database you'd like to monitor.
